A WaffleHacks project that provides solutions to food insecurities among college students.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
- **Flutter**
- **C++**
- **HMTL**

## üí° Inspiration 
MealMate unites students worldwide, driven by a shared struggle against food insecurity. Our diverse NutriHackz team is dedicated to developing a tech solution for this relatable issue. Join us in transforming how students access nutritious meals and combat food insecurities. Together, we will make a difference!

## ü§î Purpose
MealMate is a versatile web and mobile app that offers users a range of helpful features:
- **Restaurant Recommendations:** Discover nearby restaurants that fit your budget and cater to your specific dietary needs.

- **Workshop Suggestions:** Access a curated list of workshops and events focused on healthy feeding habits in your local area.

## üé® Design
We were heavily inspired by the revised version of Double Diamond design process, which not only includes visual design, but a full-fledged research cycle in which you must discover and define your problem before tackling your solution & then finally deploy it.
